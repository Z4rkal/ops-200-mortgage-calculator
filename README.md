This project is a recreation of my Mortgage Calculator react project that I wrote while learning to write my own tests in mocha.

You can clone this project to your machine with `git clone git@github.com:Z4rkal/ops200-mortgage-calculator.git`.
Then you can download the dependencies with `npm install` and you can run the tests with `npm test`.
The app can be built and launched with `npm start`, and the server listens on port 3000, which you can access by going to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

The project itself is almost the same as the old Mortgage Calculator, but without the amortization schedule functionality. The old project is located [here](https://github.com/Z4rkal/React-Mortgage-Calculator).
